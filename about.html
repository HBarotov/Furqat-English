                        <h2>Balanced General English</h2>
                        <p>My course lasts for 11 months from September until the end of July. During this period, the main areas of contemporary English. This course is for everyone above 12, but it is a great plus that the student has a little knowledge of English. The entire course consists of two parts: grammar and vocabulary as mentioned.</p>
                        <p>In the former section are 60 important units beginning with the Dates in English and ending with the usage and forms of the pronoun 'other'. A large amount of homework is always given to the students to do at the end of every lesson, and this enables them to remember and develop the concepts. Every datum is backed up with irrefutable evidence from the books of leading phonetics round the globe.</p>
                        <p>There are 3 books included in the vocabulary course, all of which compromise the most common words and collocations in English. The difficulty of each of these resources increases one by one. The first one is dedicated to Beginners' vocabulary, whereas the last one contains collocations. </p>
